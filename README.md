In this game, you control a hero navigating a 10x10 grid-based dungeon. Your goal is to defeat monsters, avoid traps, collect items (weapons, armor, potions, and artifacts), and progress through levels by reaching the exit. The game features a simple combat system with critical hits, an inventory system, and randomly generated items based on the player's level.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- **Dungeon Navigation**: Move through a grid-based map with walls, monsters, traps, and exits.
- **Combat System**: Fight monsters with a chance for critical hits, earning experience points (EP) to level up.
- **Inventory Management**: Collect and equip items like weapons, armor, potions, and artifacts.
- **Level Progression**: Advance through multiple levels loaded from text files.
- **Traps**: Encounter traps that deal damage, with increasing severity in higher levels.

## üì•Installation

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - A C++ compiler supporting C++11 or later (e.g., g++, MSVC).
   - Windows operating system for full color support (ANSI color codes may work on Unix-like systems with compatible terminals).

2. **Steps**:
   - Clone or download this repository.
   - Ensure the files `level1.txt` and `monsters.csv` are in the same directory as the executable.
   - Compile the source code:
     ```bash
     g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp -o dungeon
     ```
   - Run the game:
     - Windows: `dungeon.exe`
     - Linux/macOS (with compatible terminal): `./dungeon`

## üïπÔ∏èGameplay Controls

- **W**: Move up
- **A**: Move left
- **S**: Move down
- **D**: Move right
- **I**: Open inventory to equip or use items
- **Q**: Quit the game
- **S** (in the start menu): Start the game
- **I** (in the start menu): View inventory

## üìúFile Formats

The game relies on two external files:

### `level1.txt`
- A 10x10 grid representing the dungeon map.
- Symbols:
  - `W`: Wall (impassable)
  - `S`: Starting position of the player
  - `E`: Exit to the next level
  - `T`: Treasure chest (contains an item)
  - `M`: Monster
  - ` ` (space): Empty floor
- Example:
  ```
  WWWWWWWWWW
  W    S   W
  WM W W W W
  W  M E S W
  WM W W   W
  WS     M W
  WWWWWW M W
  WE   W   W
  WS     W W
  WWWWWWWWWW
  ```

### `monsters.csv`
- A CSV file defining monsters with their stats.
- Format: `id,ep,level,name,hp,atk,def,critChance`
- Columns:
  - `id`: Unique monster ID (integer)
  - `ep`: Experience points awarded (integer)
  - `level`: Monster level (integer)
  - `name`: Monster name (string)
  - `hp`: Hit points (integer)
  - `atk`: Attack value (integer)
  - `def`: Defense value (integer)
  - `critChance`: Critical hit chance (float, e.g., 0.05 for 5%)
- Example:
  ```
  id,ep,level,name,hp,atk,def,critChance
  1,50,1,Goblin,30,5,2,0.05
  2,100,2,Troll,50,8,4,0.1
  ```

## System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows (recommended for full color support). Linux/macOS with an ANSI-compatible terminal may work, but some features (e.g., console colors) may not function as intended.
- **Compiler**: Any C++ compiler supporting C++11 (e.g., g++, MSVC).
- **Dependencies**: Standard C++ libraries only.

## Notes

- The game uses Windows-specific console functions (`SetConsoleTextAttribute`, `Sleep`, `_getch`). For better cross-platform compatibility, consider modifying these to use standard C++ or libraries like `ncurses`.
- Additional levels can be added by creating files named `level2.txt`, `level3.txt`, etc., following the same format as `level1.txt`.
- The game currently supports a single player and does not save progress between sessions.
